This is a sample project I am using to familarize myself primarly with Cloud9 IDE, 
node.js, express, and socket.io. Although there are other packages thrown into
the mix.

The project consists of a node.js server and client page.  Once the server is started
the user can access the server by browsing to http://localhost:1337/.  Once the page
is loaded it will automatically connect to the server and start display responses.

Several connections can be done by connecting to the server URL from multiple browser
instances or computers.

Use the buttons on the client page to interact with the server.  Each button exercises
various protocol commands.  Some commands are just between the client and the server,
while others will be broadcasted to all connected clients.

There is enough support in the code to use it as the basis for a chat client or a 
collaboration tool.

This project has only been tested using Chrome.


Setup
-----

Once the project is checked out of GitHub, you may need to install additional 
packages if you don't already have them installed.

    $ npm install -g express
    $ npm install -g socket.io


Things not working
------------------

  * The "connect" button doesn't seem to work after disconnecting.
